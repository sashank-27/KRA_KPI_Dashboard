# Tasks Dashboard - Real-Time Daily Tasks Management

This document describes the new real-time daily tasks management feature that allows admins to monitor all tasks submitted by users in real-time.

## Features

### Real-Time Updates
- **Live Connection Status**: Visual indicator showing connection status to the real-time server
- **Instant Notifications**: New tasks appear immediately without page refresh
- **Live Activity Feed**: Real-time activity log showing all task-related events
- **Auto-Refresh Statistics**: Task statistics update automatically when changes occur

### Admin Dashboard
- **Comprehensive Task View**: See all tasks from all users across all departments
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by status, department, and search terms
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Live counts of total, in-progress, and closed tasks
- **Activity Monitoring**: Live feed of all task-related activities

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend (Node.js + Socket.IO)
- **Socket.IO Server**: Real-time communication server
- **Admin Room**: Dedicated room for admin users to receive updates
- **Event Broadcasting**: Emits events for task creation, updates, deletion, and status changes
- **Automatic Statistics Updates**: Triggers stats refresh on any task change

#### Frontend (Next.js + Socket.IO Client)
- **Real-Time Component**: `RealTimeTaskDashboard.tsx` - Main admin dashboard
- **Socket Connection**: Automatic connection to backend with reconnection
- **Live Updates**: Real-time task list updates without page refresh
- **Activity Feed**: Live activity log with timestamps and event types

## Usage

### For Admins
1. Navigate to the "Tasks Dashboard" section in the sidebar
2. View all tasks submitted by users across all departments
3. Monitor live activity feed for real-time updates
4. Use filters to narrow down tasks by status or department
5. Toggle real-time updates on/off as needed

### For Users
- Users continue to submit tasks through the normal interface
- All task submissions are immediately visible to admins in real-time
- No changes to existing user workflow

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. Install Socket.IO dependency:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm install socket.io
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Install Socket.IO client:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm install socket.io-client
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Real-Time Events
- `new-task`: Emitted when a new task is created
- `task-updated`: Emitted when a task is updated
- `task-deleted`: Emitted when a task is deleted
- `task-status-updated`: Emitted when task status changes
- `task-stats-update`: Emitted to trigger statistics refresh

### Socket Events
- `join-admin-room`: Join the admin room for real-time updates
- `leave-admin-room`: Leave the admin room

## File Structure

└── components/

        └── DailyTaskManagement.tsx      # Enhanced with real-time features

├── controllers/
│   └── dailyTaskController.js           # Enhanced with Socket.IO events
├── index.js                             # Socket.IO server setup
└── package.json                         # Added socket.io dependency
```

## Configuration

### Socket.IO Configuration
- **CORS**: Configured for `http://localhost:3000`
- **Credentials**: Enabled for authentication
- **Admin Room**: `admin-room` for admin-specific updates

### Real-Time Settings
- **Auto-Connect**: Automatically connects on component mount
- **Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- **Toggle**: Can be disabled/enabled by admin users

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: All socket connections require valid authentication
- **Admin-Only**: Real-time features are restricted to admin users
- **Room-Based**: Admin users join a dedicated room for updates
- **Validation**: All task operations go through existing validation

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Updates**: Only sends necessary data for each event
- **Connection Management**: Proper cleanup of socket connections
- **Activity Limit**: Activity feed limited to last 10 events
- **Conditional Rendering**: Real-time features can be toggled off

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Issues**: Check if backend server is running on port 5000
2. **Authentication Errors**: Ensure user is logged in and has admin privileges
3. **Missing Updates**: Verify socket connection status indicator
4. **Performance Issues**: Disable real-time updates if needed

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for socket connection logs
- Monitor network tab for WebSocket connections
- Verify backend logs for socket events

## Future Enhancements

- **Push Notifications**: Browser notifications for important events
- **User-Specific Rooms**: Individual user rooms for targeted updates
- **Message History**: Persistent activity log storage
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated filtering options
- **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience for real-time updates
